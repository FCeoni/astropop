# AstroPoP

The (non) famous ASTROnomical POlarimetry and Photometry pipeline. Developed for work with IAGPOL polarimeter at Observat√≥rio Pico dos Dias (Brazil), but suitable to be used in other image polarimeters around the world.

# Important

Now, I'm transporting it from my personal python package [astrojc](https://github.com/juliotux/astrojc) and soon I will get a full functional version here.

# Features:

This software is intended to provide a full pipeline to reduce raw polarimetry and photometry data taken with common CCD telescope cameras. It can do:
- Create calibrate frames;
- Calibrate images using bias/flat/dark frames;
- Gain correction and in-processing image binnig;
- Cosmic ray extraction (astroscrappy);
- Align image sets;
- Aperture and (planned) PSF photometry;
- Calcite and (planned) polaroid polarimeters;
  - Automatic pairs of stars identification;
- Automatic photometry calibration using online catalogs.

A paper with the science verification results and the full methodology is in preparation and should be submitted soon.
